# SudokuGenerator

Generates Sudokus with unique solution and evaluates its difficulty based on hardest strategy, number of givens, number of searches required and other factors

(Currently in Development)

#### Info

In order to evaluate the difficulty of a generated sudoku, the Generator has to have a full working Solver implemented, in order to find the hardest strategy needed to solve the puzzle

The Solver implements all the known solving strategies taken from [HoDoKu](http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/)

## Build With

* Java 8

## Examples

Currently in Development... Examples coming as soon as it is done

## TODO

* [ ] Finish Solver
* [ ] Implement the rest of the strategies (Solving Techniques)
* [ ] Extract the Solver and create a standalone library
* [ ] Unit testing
* [ ] Performance testing
